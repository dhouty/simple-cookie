# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> Learning how to use the module was pretty straight forward as the creator already had a basic readme file. One aspect that made the module's code easy to understand was that it was rather short, which means there wasn't enough stuff going on to make it very complex. Something that would have made it easier to understand is better coding style. It was pretty sloppy in my opinion and I could think of a few better ways to implement some of the methods that would make understanding it a little easier.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> To me, it means summarizing the purpose of the method, so someone who would like to use it can understand what it does without needing to understand how it does it. I would tell a CSE 142 student that they should try to write comments that effectively communicate what the method does, without going into details of its implementation.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Roughly 6 hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> The only help I sought after was the JSDoc documentation.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I didn't encounter any major issues.
